1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?

An inline element is an element used as a style attribute in HTML element while
A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available 
(stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).


2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely?

When an element is positioned absolutely that means it's computed position value is fixed.

3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but 
also have the ability to give it a width?

By setting these to 0 in your stylesheet, you can take away the default space
that gets put in after these elements. Negative margins allows you to overlap things too, 
but is not the best method to do so because of browser 
inconsistencies and what have you â€” use positioning to achieve all that.


4. Name 4 elements that are diplay block by default, 5 elements that are display inline by default and 
1 element that is display inline-block by default 5. In your own words, 
explain the box model. What is the fix for the box mod

Block display:
a. <div>
b. <span>
c. <section>

Inline dispay:
